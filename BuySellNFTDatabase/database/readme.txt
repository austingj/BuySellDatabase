Austin: Created 10 functions for the ROOT USER. Created a Big Creators option to list the users who have minted the most number of NFTs. Created a 
Big Sellers button to list all the users who sold the most NFTs. Created a Big Buyers button to list all the top users who bought the most NFTs. If there 
is a tie within any of the Big creators,sellers, or buyers, it will list all those that tied. Created a Hot NFTs button to list the nfts with the most owners.
If there is a tie it will list all the nfts that are tied. Created a Common NFTs page where the user will get two users X and Y, from a drop down menulist
and then it will redirect them to a page that shows the common NFTs between those two users. Created a Diamond Hands button that will list users who have
purchased some NFTs and then have never sold them. Created a Paper Hands button that lists users who have purchased NFts but then have sold them afterwards.
Created a Good Buyers button that lists all users who have purchased atleast 3 NFTs. Created an  Inactive users button that lists users who have
never minted, bought, sold, or transferred any NFTs. Created a Statistics Button that will send the root user to search for a user, afterwards clicking on
that user will send them to that users statistics page witch will then show the total number of buys, sells, transfers, and number of NFTs that user owns currently.

Instructions: Unzip the database folder and load project into eclipse. After that you can run one of the files run as on server and login as the root with 
the username: root password: pass1234 
After logging in on root you can initialize the database by hitting the button which will create the tables for User, NFTDatabase, and ownsDatabase and listings
and Transactions database. After logging on the root you can view any of the Big creators, sellers, buyers, hot nfts, common nfts, diamond hands, paper hands,
good buyers, inactive users, and statistics for a searchable user. This will require transactions within other users to show valuable information.
